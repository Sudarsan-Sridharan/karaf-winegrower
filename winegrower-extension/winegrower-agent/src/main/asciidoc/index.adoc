= Apache Winegrower Agent

The Apache Winegrower agent provides a Javaagent which will
starts Winegrower `Ripener` class.

It uses the same configuration as other extensions and it is read from
the agent args.

It provides a shade jar which is easier to use:

----
-javaagent:winegrower-agent-${winegrower.version}-fatjar.jar
----

With configuration it can look like:

[source,sh]
----
-javaagent:winegrower-agent-${winegrower.version}-fatjar.jar=workDir=/tmp/winegrower|ignoredBundles=cxf
----

You can see the available options and their actual values activating the debug mode which will log the whole configuration:

[source,sh]
----
-Dwinegrower.agent.debug=true
----
